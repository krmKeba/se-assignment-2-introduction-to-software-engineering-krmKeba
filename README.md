# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
>The systematic application of engineering principle, methodes and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
>Programming consists of creating script, writing, tseting and updating code while Software engineering involves all aspects of software creation.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
>Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintainance


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
>Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
>Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
>Implimentation- Writing code and building software according to the design specifications
>Testing- Conducting tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
>Deployment- Releasing software to users or customers
Maintainance- Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after Deployment

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
>Agile models are Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development while Waterfall models are a Sequential approach with distint phases flowing downwards like a waterfall
> Agile models Emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback and in Waterfall models each phase must be completed before the next begins.
>Agile models are used in large scale projects like Application Development while Waterfall models are used in Product Development

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
>Requirements Engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for software or system development
>It involves defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
>It is important for Quality Assurance, Foundation Development, steakholder communication, etc

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
>Creating software in a way tha minimizes dependencies amoung the components of a system
> It makes your code more organized, reusable, and maintainable

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
>Unit Testing- The process where you test the smallest functional unit of code
>Itegratin Testing- Checking individual components or units of software project to expose defects or problems to verifie that they work together as designed
>System Testing- Process in which quality assurance team evaluates how various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application
>Acceptance Testing- Software testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements
>Testing is crutial beacause it improves consistancy and performance
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
>Are tools designed to help manage changes to a source code over time
>it is important because it keeps a history of all changes made to the code base, allows collaboration amd provides contious integration and delivary
>Examples- Git, Mercurial, Perforce Helix Core etc 

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
>Role of a Software Project Manager is to lead the work of a team to achieve all the objects and goals with in agiven constraints
>Key responsibilities- Project planning and scheduling, Team leadership and management etc
>Challenges faced- Time management, Budget management, Recource allocation, Risk management 

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
>Process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to improver the software
>Maintenance Activities
-Corrective Maintainenan: Fixing defects or bugs found in the software 
-Adaptive Maintenance: Modifying the software to keep it compatible a changing environment
-Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing the software to improve performance or maintainability
-Preventive Maintain: Making changes to prevent potential future issues
-Emergency MaintenaceL: Addressing unexpected issues that need immediate attention

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
>Ethical issues: Transparency and honesty, Social impact, Profecssional responsibility etc.
>Adherance of these Issues: they follow a set of guidelines, principles, and professional standards designed to promote responsible behavior and decision-making

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
